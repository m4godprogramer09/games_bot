# games_bot
All the source files for games and the chat bot  

Firstly welcome 

source code for all the games on the web site is or will be here shortly 

Second to run chat bot with out the exe on the site you will need some packages so download them first

to start first run training.py, this file will train and create the model using tensorflow it will also save the model in a new folder it creates 

so there is no need to run training.py again if you do not change any thing in the intents.json . json file holds all the responses and possible conversations.

After creating the model run the chatbot.py file this has all the cleanig up code and will start the conversion in the terminal. 

have a good day
